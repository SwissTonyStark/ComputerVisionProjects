    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook aims to create a basic image classifier using pre-trained models available on the Hugging Face platform. The main goal is to build a reproducible and scalable machine learning pipeline that demonstrates essential computer vision skills. By utilizing Docker, Jupyter Notebook, and pre-trained models like Vision Transformer (ViT), this project serves as a foundational piece of a personal portfolio that showcases proficiency in various AI tools and techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we will:\n",
    "- Load and explore a public dataset.\n",
    "- Utilize a pre-trained model to perform image classification.\n",
    "- Document all processes in a structured manner for ease of understanding.\n",
    "- Use Docker to ensure that our environment can be easily replicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to show not only technical skills but also the ability to clearly communicate the steps taken, making the project understandable and attractive to future employers. Let's get started!"
